## Examples

The `quill neuron-manage` command has many uses, each operating on a neuron in a different way. The examples below will all operate on a hypothetical neuron 2313380519530470538.

To vote YES on a proposal such as [108005]:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --register-vote 108005
```

Or to vote NO on that same proposal:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --register-vote 108005 --reject
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            RegisterVote = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

To follow another neuron, such as ICPMN, on a specific topic, such as Governance:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --follow-neurons 4966884161088437903 --follow-topic 4
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Follow = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

If a neuron does not take any action for more than 6 months, it will start losing voting power and thus voting rewards. To avoid that, neurons can vote directly or set which neurons they follow. To confirm the current following setting and refresh voting power without making any changes:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --refresh-following
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            RefreshVotingPower = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

To stake a neuron's maturity, for example 25% of it, increasing its voting power:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --stake-maturity 25
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            StakeMaturity = record {
                maturity_e8s = 750_000_000 : nat64;
                staked_maturity_e8s = 250_000_000 : nat64;
            }
        };
    }
)
```

"e8s" is a shorthand for meaning the number of 1e-8s, or one-hundred-millionths, of an ICP in integer form; this response must be divided by 100,000,000 to get the real maturity, which in this case would be 7.5 and 2.5.

To disburse a fully dissolved neuron, meaning to convert it into ICP and transfer it to its controller:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --disburse
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Disburse = record {
                transfer_block_height = 5_581_035 : nat64;
            }
        };
    }
)
```

The block height, also known as the block index, can be looked up on the [IC dashboard].

To spawn a new neuron, meaning to convert all the maturity from this neuron into a new one (that can be disbursed after one week):

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --spawn
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            SpawnResponse = record {
                created_neuron_id = opt record {
                    id = 4966884161088437902 : nat64;
                };
            }
        };
    }
)
``` 

To increase the neuron's dissolve delay, for example by a full year:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538--additional-dissolve-delay-seconds 31536000
```

To start dissolving a neuron:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --start-dissolving
```

Or to stop:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --stop-dissolving
```

To enable auto-staking a neuron's maturity:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --auto-stake-maturity enabled
```

Or to disable:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --auto-stake-maturity disabled
```

To join the IC's community fund:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --join-community-fund
```

Or to leave:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --leave-community-fund
```

To add a neuron hotkey, such as (for example purposes) the management canister:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --add-hot-key aaaaa-aa
```

Or to remove it:

```sh
quill neuron-manage 2313380519530470538 --remove-hot-key aaaaa-aa
```

These 'configuration' operations will all produce a response like:

```candid
(
    record {
        command = opt variant {
            Configure = record {}
        };
    }
)
```

## Remarks

As this is an update call, it will not actually make the request, but rather generate a signed and packaged request that can be sent from anywhere. You can use the `--qr` flag to display it as a QR code, or if you are not working with an air-gapped machine, you can pipe it to `quill send -`.
